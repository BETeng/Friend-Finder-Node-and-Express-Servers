### The FriendFinder app will ask you a set of survey questions and then find a compatible friend from a set of existing individuals. 

Upon opening, a survey will pop up and when all questions are enetered it will match the survey results agasint a pool of other users. It'll then find the user with the most similar answers to yourself and pull up their name and image. Upon finishing the survey your answers and name will also be entered into the database so others may match with you as well.
